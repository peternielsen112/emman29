### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<h3> My name is Emmanuel Alabi, and I'm a fifteen year old Front-End Responsive Web Developer (yeah, long title), based somewhere on the continent of Africa.</h3>
<p>

I have been learning Web Development from the likes of freeCodeCamp and w3schools since 2020, and I still continue to do so. As of now, I can build a static webpage, such as a product landing page or a personal portfolio like this one.

Sometime in the near future I aim to be a full-stack developer, hopefully working with a reknowned tech company. For now, however, I am willing to take small front-end jobs. You can contact me at alabiemmanuel029@gmail.com </p>
